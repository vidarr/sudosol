# sudosol

Sudoku solver with a simple GUI

# Setup

There is no setup.

# Execution

Just call

    python gui.py

This will give you a blank sudoku board where you can place preset numbers.
Click 'Solve' at the bottom and wait...
As soon as all solutions have been found (if you use a Sudoku posed within a
magazine or so there should only be ONE ) the board will be filled with the 
first solution and the 'Solve' button will turn into a 'Next solution' button.
Clicking it will present you another solution if one is available.

That's it.
